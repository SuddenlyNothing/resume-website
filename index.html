        <h2>Me and Code</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Bix. I enjoy making things with computers. Ever since I first
          experienced coding on Khan Acadamy's browser Javascript editor, I've been intruiged by
          the power of computers. After experiencing the joys of game development, I don't see
          myself ever giving up coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of computers, I enjoy playing golf and watching TV shows. Ever since college
          started, I haven't been able to pursue these as much as I would like but after placing
          third in a college club golf tournament I'm proud to say that I still have the golf
          skills!
